        <h3>Strategy & Planning</h3>
        <p class="stratdesc">System architects are responsible for designing and implementing short and long-term strategic goals for managing and maintaining systems and software. In addition, they must make sure
          that all planned and in-place system architectures are aligned with the specific firm’s goals. They provide their expertise and architectural assistance to other IT personnel including software teams, System Analysts and Engineers. They
          conduct research on new technologies in the field of systems development and create and develop plans for investing in such systems that will increase cost effectiveness and flexibility.</p>

        <img class="merg" src="Images/merg.png" alt="Acquisition Picture">
        <h3>Acquisition & Deployment</h3>
        <p class="acq">In this area of responsibility, System Architects design, create and monitor the implementation of end-to-end integrated systems. They also review new and existing system designs
          and make recommendations for improving or altering the systems. Negotiating and administering vendor and consultant contracts is also key in this area.</p>

        <img class="ops" src="Images/ops.png" alt="IT Ops Management Picture">
        <h3>Operation Management</h3>
        <p class="OpsMan">System Architects consult with department heads and end-users to further infrastructure development. They develop and execute test plans to check technical performance of infrastructure and report
          findings. Based on findings, they make recommendations for improvement. They also develop policies for standardizing systems and manage many of the aspects of IT staffing.</p>

        <h3>Integrity of Systems</h3>
        <p class="intS">The System Architect is tasked with a balanced and focused development of the system and its maintenance no matter if requirements change. For example, if a reduction in cost is required, the System Architect must not sacrifice the
          system’s performance or reliability.</p>
